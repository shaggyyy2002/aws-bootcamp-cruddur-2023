## Project Scenario

A startup company has decided to build their own micro-blogging platform and has hired you to be its first cloud engineer. The company paid a web-development firm to translate their wireframe designs into a mock web-application for the purpose of demoing to raise capital.

After a successful round of funding, you [the cloud engineer] have been tasked with taking the mock web-application and making it production ready at scale. 

The startup company consulted a fractional CTO to help choose some of the technical requirements to place the company on a good technical roadmap:

- The frontend application should be written in Javascript using React (functional components).
- The backend application should be written in Python using Flask. Since we plan to be API only
- Since we want to choose a popular framework API only framework
- Since we want a micro-framework because we are offloading as much to the cloud as possible to avoid be a monolithic application
- Since we donâ€™t want an ORM because the CTO considers it an anti-pattern
- Since Python is the most popular language being learned for cloud right now. That an API specification be defined detailing the exact endpoints required.
The web application:
  - Shall be deployed to AWS.
  - Takes advantage of modern-applications cloud services.

The startup company has spent the majority of their funding on hiring you for the next 6 months (but mostly spent the money on marketing and buying a really cool domain) and so you also need to ensure you keep the cloud provider costs as low as possible.
